Introduction

Summarize previously known results on covering numbers for groups. Covering number. 


Background

Definitions: Mention generators and relations, 2-group, powerful 2-group, powerful covering, powerful covering number ($\sigma_p)$, commutator, $G^p$, dihedral group. 


Preliminary Results


Whatever is necessary. 

Subgroup lattice and word-forms. 

D has three maximal subgroups. 

Question: What are the maximal abelian subgroups of D?

Question: What are the maximal powerful subgroups of D? 

Main Results

Theorem: The powerful covering number of dihedral groups
